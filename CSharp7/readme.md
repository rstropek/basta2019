# C# 7 Code Samples

## Introduction

I use these simple code samples to demonstrate new C# 7 language features in Visual Studio 2017.

**Note:** You can use *C# Interactive* to demo the C# 7 features, too. To launch C# interactive, run `csi` in a Developer Command Prompt.


## Change C# Language Version

In order to try the demos in your own code, don't forget to [change the language version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version).
